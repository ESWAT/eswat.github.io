          <p class="Testimonial-case">Crossover Health helps their clients maintain a healthy, motivated workforce using innovative health centers. Working with the CTO and a small team to overhaul their healthcare application, I provided responsive design, React development, CSS architecture and guidance on UI practices. This resulted in an easy-to-use, cross-platform application that is loved by not only their customers but also their own staff.</p>
          <p class="Testimonial-content">Philip knows his stuff, plain and simple. He can dive into visual design tasks if we need help there. Or he can jump into the front-end and help us with architecture and setting the pace for maintainable code. I have nothing but great things to say about him and he’s been a valuable partner to work with on our projects.</p>

          <p class="Testimonial-case">Tiny Hearts, a digital product studio acquired by Shopify in 2016, created apps from their own ideas and those of their clients. I worked with the founder and lead designer to develop their new website, to better represent the studio’s ambitions and the amazing work they’ve done. The result was a responsive website that made their message of being both a product development and client services business clearer.</p>
          <p class="Testimonial-content">As our catalogue of apps and clients grew we realized our website wasn’t doing its best to describe our mission or client work anymore. Working with Philip enabled our team to continue focusing on our products and partners while he took care of the development of our new website. We couldn’t have been happier with the results.</p>

          <p class="Testimonial-case">42 is a point of sale analytics platform that helps brands draw better insights from their data. I worked with the founders to design and integrate new features or refine existing ones that would be valuable to their customers. This resulted in a UI that made good on 42’s goal of making intuitive sense out of complicated data, in addition to improving customer retention and reducing support needs.</p>
          <p class="Testimonial-content">Philip is a beast! Calling him a designer is a misnomer. He dove right into our tech stack, zero ramp-up time needed, doing what was necessary to get his sick design work in-front of our users. From designing and implementing web components to optimizing our Grunt toolchain, Philip’s holistic approach to design saved us valuable time and money. It’s clear that Philip is a true professional and has been doing this for years. A++ would hire again.</p>

          <p class="Testimonial-case">Benbria helps brands connect with their customers using Loop, a guest engagement platform that supports smartphones, kiosks and more. I worked with various departments in Benbria to design and develop improvements to their existing features and prototype new products to help Loop expand to more markets.</p>
          <p class="Testimonial-content">I have worked with Philip for the past 3 years. Philip is the kind of designer that any kind of company in our industry wish they had. He excels at designing beautiful, accessible interfaces and integrating them into our product on his own. Philip has helped us continuously reimagine our flagship product for different verticals and bring in new clients quickly. He cares deeply about our company, offering us guidance on our product design strategy and front-end architecture. I wholeheartedly recommend him for any design related work.</p>
